            <P class="topic1_content">Bodybuilding is the process of developing the muscles through 
                    specific diets and physical exercise, especially weightlifting, sometimes for muscle 
                    and physique competitions.<br>The purpose of a bodybuilding workout differs from a general 
                    fitness workout. A fitness routine primarily tones the muscles and helps with weight loss 
                    while a bodybuilding workout is designed to increase muscle mass, or to “bulk up.” Most bodybuilders
                    are never in competitions but are motivated by the desire to get stronger for work, or for a
                    better-looking or more fit body, usually with defined major muscles in the arms, chest, legs, 
                    shoulders, and back. Some bodybuilders concentrate on the upper body while others focus on the 
                    lower body. Often, this is because the bodybuilder is concentrating on the muscles that will most 
                    help him or her in a sport, such as football, baseball, tennis, and soccer. Sometimes a bodybuilder
                    will concentrate on a specific area of the body, such as the arms, chest, or legs.<br>Bodybuilding is 
                    practiced by millions of men, women, seniors, and teenagers around the world. It is especially popular 
                    in Europe and North America. In the United States, weightlifting (a similar activity to bodybuilding),
                    is the second most popular exercise activity, next to walking, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                    About 13% of people age 15 and older who engage in sports or exercise activities in the U.S. do weightlifting, 
                    the Bureau reports.</P>
            <p class="topic1_content">Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to 
                     perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper
                     nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.
                     Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's activities without 
                     undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a
                     measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy,
                     to resist hypokinetic diseases, improve immune system and to meet emergency situations</p>
